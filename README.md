## Notebook Overview
- AC-first-look
  - Look at RECCAP2 Ocean mask
  - Look at and do some simple plots of MPI data
- AC-loop
  - intake search
  - processing function
  - processing loop over all models
  - combine base variables with CDO (e.g. terrestrial carbon = cVeg + cSoil)
  - Some CDO error investigation
  - First plots of the processed data
- AC-maps
  - Map plots for all varibales comparing ssp126 and ssp370 to historical
- AO-fgco2-loop
  - old processing code
- CMIP6-Model-availability
  - Code to check with intake which models have a certain set of varibles
  - Produces a table with color coded lists
- Create_gridareas_UHH-CMIP6
  - adapted code from the UHH SIA CMIP6 product
  - Processing functions to calculate gridareas using CDO for land and ocean vars
- RECCAP
  - Code to reproduce the RECCAP2 plots
  - lines can be either colorcoded by scenario or model
